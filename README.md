# My project

is a CLI application that helps users manage their expenses and track their spending. It helps individuals who are unaware of where their money goes each month, often leading to overspending.

- Xpense-Manager is a web application that helps users manage their expenses and track their spending. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting expenses, as well as generating reports and charts to help users visualize their spending patterns.

## Features

- xpense-Manager is built using Python . It uses a SQLite database to store expense data.
- Add income: Users can add new income by providing a description, amount, and date.
- Add expenses: Users can add new expenses by providing a description, amount, and date.
- Edit expenses: Users can edit existing expenses by providing a new description, amount, and date.
- Add Budget: Users can add new budget by providing a description, amount, and date.

# xpense-Manager Solution

# Tracking Expenses

- Solution: An expense manager helps track daily, weekly, and monthly spending by categorizing expenses (e.g., groceries, entertainment, rent). This allows users to see patterns and pinpoint where their money goes.

# Budgeting

- Solution: An expense manager helps create a budget by setting a monthly spending limit. Users can then track their spending against this limit to stay within their financial goals.

# Expense Categorization

- Solution: Automatically categorizes expenses (e.g., food, transportation, utilities) for a clearer understanding of spending habits, making it easier to identify areas where costs can be reduced.

# Saving Goals

- Allows you to set savings targets and tracks progress toward reaching those goals.

# Conclusion

- Expense manager is a valuable tool for anyone looking to take control of their finances and make informed financial decisions. By tracking expenses, setting budgets, and categorizing spending, users can gain insights into their spending habits and make informed financial decisions.
